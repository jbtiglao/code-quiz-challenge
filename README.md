# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

For this unit's assignment, we are tasked to build a timed, interactive coding quiz with multiple-choice questions, for the purpose of familiarizing ourselves with coding assessments that include both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges, as a part of the interview process for full-stack web developers.

In addition, this assignment aims to allow us to use the skills covered in the unit. The application will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 


## Installation

This application runs in the browser while its HTML, CSS, JS, images, and README files can be accessed through the author's GitHub repository at https://github.com/jbtiglao.

Below is the application's interface. It is deployed at the following URL: https://jbtiglao.github.io/code-quiz-challenge/.

## Usage

This application enables a coding bootcamp student (user) to take a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores, so that the user can gauge the user's progress compared to the user's peers. 

In accordance with the given mock-up and required acceptance criteria, the application has the following functionalities:

* A start button the user clicks to start taking a code quiz.  The start button also starts the timer.

* When the user answers a  question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.

* When the user answers a  question incorrectly, 10 points are subtracted from the user's score.

* When all the questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0, the game is over.

* When the game is over, the user can save the user's initials and score.

* A submit button, which when clicked by the user saves the user's final score and initials.
